# FinPy: Finance in Python

Welcome to the **FinPy** repository, the emerging Python package for financial data analysis and visualization. This package aims to be a comprehensive collection of Python modules and Jupyter Notebooks designed to assist users in the analysis and visualization of financial data. Please note that FinPy is currently under active development, and many of the intended features are not yet implemented.

## Project Status

**IMPORTANT**: FinPy is in its early stages of development. As such, the codebase is subject to significant changes, and many functionalities are still being developed. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards our first stable release.

## Planned Features

- **Data Collection**: Modules for retrieving financial data from various sources (in development).
- **Data Processing**: Tools for cleaning and organizing financial data (upcoming).
- **Analysis**: Algorithms and models for financial analysis (upcoming).
- **Visualization**: Functions for creating insightful charts and graphs (in development).
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks with examples and tutorials (upcoming).

## Installation

Since FinPy is still in development, it is not yet available for installation via pip. However, you can clone the repository to try out the existing features and contribute to its development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibasterreche/finpy.git
cd finpy
```

## Usage

To use the current version of FinPy, you can import the package in your Python environment after cloning the repository:

```python
import finpy
```

Please refer to the documentation within the code for guidance on using the available modules.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation will be provided with the first stable release. In the meantime, please refer to the docstrings and comments within the codebase for guidance.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you would like to contribute to FinPy, please check out the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines on how to proceed.
